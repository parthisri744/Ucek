        <h1><u>History</u></h1>
   <p>This college was established in 2010 as one of the constituent college of Anna University, through a policy decision made by the government of Tamil Nadu at that time. But during 2011 a permanent site for the college was identified and allotted
    by the Government of Tamil Nadu, on the Chennai-Bangalore Highway, Karaipettai village. The new site consists of a total land area of about 10.4 acres. As of June 2012 constructions are nearing completion for the initial plan of 4 laboratories,
    4 class rooms, office and Dean's cabin. On 5 April 2013, Dean's office and 4 class rooms were shifted to the new campus. On 27 November 2013, the girls' hostel was shifted to a nearby building on the Paranthur Road, This building is a new
    building in which all the girl students are accommodated instead of the 3 different buildings in the Kanchipuram town 10 km from the college. The work for the construction of academic and administrative blocks along with hostels for girls
    and boys was completed in academic year 2014-15. So far there have been four batches of students from the academic year 2010-2011 who are currently pursuing their degree program in this engineering institution.</p>
